# ðŸŽ° Python Slot Machine Game

This is a command-line slot machine game built in Python. It simulates a simple 3x3 slot machine with symbols A, B, C, and D, each having different probabilities and payout values. The player can deposit money, place bets on up to 3 lines, and spin the machine to try their luck.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `main()` â€” Entry point of the program.
- `deposit()` â€” Asks the user how much money they want to deposit.
- `get_number_of_lines()` â€” Asks the user how many lines they want to bet on (1â€“3).
- `get_bet()` â€” Asks the user how much they want to bet per line.
- `get_slot_machine_spin()` â€” Randomly generates slot symbols based on symbol weights.
- `check_winnings()` â€” Checks if the user has won based on matching lines.
- `print_slot_machine()` â€” Displays the slot machine outcome in a 3x3 format.
- `spin()` â€” Coordinates the betting and spinning logic.

## ðŸ§  How the Game Works

1. **Deposit**: The user starts by depositing a certain amount of money.
2. **Bet**: The user chooses how many lines to bet on (up to 3) and how much to bet per line.
3. **Spin**: The slot machine generates random symbols based on predefined symbol frequencies.
4. **Payout**: If all symbols in a selected line match, the player wins a payout based on the symbolâ€™s value.
5. **Repeat**: The user can continue playing until they run out of money or choose to quit.

## ðŸ’¡ Slot Symbols & Values

| Symbol | Count (Weight) | Value (Multiplier) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| A      | 2              | 5                   |
| B      | 4              | 4                   |
| C      | 6              | 3                   |
| D      | 8              | 2                   |

- Symbols with higher values are less likely to appear.
- Winning a line pays: `symbol value * bet amount`.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required. All functionality is built using Python's standard library (`random`, `input`, `print`, etc.).
